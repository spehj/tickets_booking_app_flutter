# App for Booking Tickets with Flutter

This was made by following a tutorial of YouTube creator dbestech.

Here I learned how to write a good looking UI with Flutter. I stopped working on this app when I felt I know enough basics about building UI. I started working on a [Sneznik Castle app](https://github.com/spehj/sneznik-app) after this.

## Demo of the App

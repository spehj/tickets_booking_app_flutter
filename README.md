# App for Booking Tickets with Flutter

This was made by following a tutorial of YouTube creator dbestech.

Here I learned how to write a good looking UI with Flutter.

## Demo of the App
I stopped working on this app when I felt I know enough basics about building UI. I started working on Sneznik Castle app after this.
